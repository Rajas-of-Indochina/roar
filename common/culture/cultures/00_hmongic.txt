	# 13. Extreme country culture conversion resistance. Don't make them spread out ALL over SE China like the TangMod does, as their range is rather limited outside of a large number of exclaves. However, I don't think I need to explain why their county culture conversion resistance bonus would need to be huge. These are basically the only non-Sinic peoples to thrive in China in large numbers to this day. Their shared ancestors with the Mon-Khymer people (according to wikipedia) show that they are a deeply non-Sinic people, who have regardless lived in parts of what is considered to be the core of China even. I refer you to this file for the modern distribution of the people (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hmong%E2%80%93Mien_languages#/media/File:Hmong-Mien-en.svg). We can infer that while they may have had a single connected large culture blob at some point, a massive amount of them still remain and live in their own non-Sinic ways.
