 ZYGII_GLOSS: "#bold "Northwest Caucasian"#! commonly refers to the Abkhazians, Abaza, and Circassians, as well as the Ubykh who are often classified as a Circassian tribe. They speak distinct but related languages, and their culture, society, and mythology share many aspects. Historically, they made a living through farming, herding animals, hunting, trading, fishing, beekeeping, raiding and piracy. They are indigenous to the Northern Caucasus and share common descent from ancient peoples who lived around the Azov Sea and Black Sea coast, including the Maeotian, Zygii, Apsillian, and Cercetae tribes, with some influence from conqueror populations who had assimilated among them, such as Sarmatians and various Turkic peoples."

 NARTS_GLOSS: "#bold "Narts"#! are a legendary tribe of heroes deeply woven into the mythologies of nearly all the peoples of the Northern Caucasus, especially the Circassians, Alans, and Abkhazians, who all claim descent from them. Their epic tales, known as the Nart Sagas or the Nartiad, form the foundation of the region’s oral tradition, passed down for centuries. The Narts were not just warriors but also wise leaders, tricksters, and semi-divine figures, often interacting with gods, supernatural beings, and each other in grand adventures. The Narts' famous declaration, "If our lives be short, let our fame be great!", has been the core of North Caucasian honor code for centuries."
