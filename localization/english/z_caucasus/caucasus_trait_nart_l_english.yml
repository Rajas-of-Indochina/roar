First crafted by hunters, the language seeks to emulate nature's sounds in order to not frighten animals, a feature that also serves as a tribute to the forest spirits' sovereignty.

Sentences are encrypted by a constantly changing system of reordering words, changing phonemes, removing certain letters and adding meaningless suffixes and prefixes. While a dedicated person can decrypt it in time, it is impossible to do so in the heat of battle, and thus it is an ideal tool for communication during warfare."

The grammar is very similar, but the vocabulary is distinct enough to make speakers of common Circassian barely be able to understand it. Not everyone is allowed to learn Werqibze, and it is certainly a great source of prestige to know it."
