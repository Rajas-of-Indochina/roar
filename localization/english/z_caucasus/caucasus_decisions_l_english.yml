In Zeik'webze, regular Circassian sentences are encrypted by reordering words, changing phonemes, removing certain letters and adding meaningless suffixes and prefixes. This is not done randomly, but based on a code that only a few people know, and if it is discovered, the code is modified. Thus, enemy armies and spies, even if they speak Circassian as their native tongue, would have no way of understanding our intentions.

They are also short-tempered, however: two people bumping into each other can trigger a feud between the two families, which could then trigger a conflict between two tribes that may last decades if not centuries. And so Circassians have been fighting each other endlessly for as long as they have existed; only bonding together when they have a common enemy.

The Circassian tribe living North of the Kuban, the Kabardians, have no doubt the worst land out of all Circassians, nothing but harsh and infertile soil, with looming threat of nomadic raids.
