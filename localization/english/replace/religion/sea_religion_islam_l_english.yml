 alevi_desc:0 "Alevism is a mystic and heterodox branch of Islam that combines elements from Shia and Sunni Islam, as well as Tengrism. Alevi doctrine is not organised, with certain beliefs held by individuals ranging from Orthodox Twelver Shi'ism to unique and heterodox. Many Alevis view the Qur'an as too holy to be taken literally, and instead, look at the teachings of Twelve Imams and Turkic spiritual leaders, as documented in the Buyruk scriptures. In Alevi belief, Allah, also known as Tengri, is El-Hakk, or "The Truth", and since Prophet Muhammad and Imam Ali are manifestations of the truth, they are the only ones to know the true meaning of the Qur'an."

 khorasani_legacy_doctrine_desc:0 "One [Glossary( 'hadith', 'HADITHS_GLOSS' )] mentions that the [Glossary( 'Mahdi', 'MAHDI_GLOSS' )] will rise from the land of Khorasan. While the Mahdi did not arrive yet, we all agree that Khorasan is a land of many great men blessed by Allah: Maturid and Fushenjan are just some of the places there to give birth to men of legendary piety. In sha Allah, will reach heaven by following in their footsteps!"

 MAHDI_GLOSS: "The #bold Mahdi#! is a figure who, according to most Muslim branches, will appear during the end times to unite all Muslims, fight against evil and set the stage for the second coming of Jesus, with whom he will ally to defeat the Antichrist."
 HADITHS_GLOSS: "A #bold "Hadith"#! is a quote, action or silent approval of the prophet Muhammad, narrated by his companions and compiled by hadith collectors; a major religious source for most Muslim groups. Thousands of hadith exist with major hadith compilations being second only to the Qur'an in authority."

 # Muminun

 muhammad_succession_muminun_doctrine_desc:0 "The divisions among the believers are the greatest trial of our age. We are all followers of the same Qur'an, and we all bow to Allah. What matters is not labels, but our faith in Allah and our commitment to justice and righteousness. The term 'Mu'minun' means 'the Believers,' and it reminds us that unity under Allah's guidance is more important than factionalism."

 # Sunni
 muhammad_succession_sunni_doctrine_desc:0 "We believe that the best canditate to lead the believers should be the leader, regardless of if they are a descendant of the prophet or not. Abu Bakr was chosen by the [Glossary( 'Ummah', 'UMMAH_BOLGHAR_GLOSS' )] as their rightful leader, thus he was the first caliph, the political leader of Islam. Religious authority should be derived from people of exceptional learning who study the Qur'an and Sunnah and pass on their teachings, forming the basis for various Sunni schools of thought. Thus, "Sunni" is an umbrella term for many schools of thought who tolerate their differences and recognize each other to be legitimate."

 # Shia
 muhammad_succession_shia_doctrine_desc:0 "We believe that the prophet designated Imam Ali to be the leader of the [Glossary( 'Ummah', 'UMMAH_BOLGHAR_GLOSS' )], and only through him can the lineage of leadership be traced! Thus, the political leader of the Muslims should descend from the prophet by his daughter Fatima, Imam Ali's wife. Religious authority should also be derived from the Imams and their students, who, being descendants of the prophet, are the obvious canditates for spiritual guidance. The term "Shia" comes from "Shiat Ali" which means "Supporters of Ali"."

 # Zandaqa 
 muhammad_succession_zandaqa_doctrine_name:0 "Zandaqa"
 muhammad_succession_zandaqa_doctrine_desc:0 "Whether they agree with us on who the rightful successor to the prophet was or not, other Muslim sects unite on deeming us to be "Zandaqa" - heretics. This is because they foolishly claim that our beliefs are exaggerations or perversions of the faith. It does not matter what they say, we know the truth!" 

 # Muhakkima
 muhammad_succession_muhakkima_doctrine_name:0 "Muhakkima"
 muhammad_succession_muhakkima_doctrine_desc:0 "Ali was Muhammad's rightful successor, but his acceptance of arbitration during the First Fitna goes against the will of Allah! Only He can judge a suitable leader for us. We don't care if all those so-called Muslims call us Kharijites - we will keep fighting for the truth!"

 # Maturidi
 maturidi_desc:0 "A branch of Orthodox Sunnism which asserts that ethics possess an objective existence discernible through human reasoning, with God commanding what is ethical because it is inherently so. Like the Ash'aris, the Maturidis emphasize that while the Qur'an and Sunnah are indispensable, human intellect is vital for interpreting them and understanding the divine nature."

 # Ashari
 ashari_desc:0 "A branch of Orthodox Sunni Islam, Ash'arism asserts that ethics stem from God's commands, holding that what is ethical is so because God has decreed it. Like the Maturidis, the Ash'aris emphasize the role of reason in interpreting the Qur'an and Sunnah, and they share with them the view that understanding God's attributes necessitates thoughtful interpretation."

 # Athari
 athari:0 "Atharism"
 athari_adj:0 "Athari"
 athari_adherent:0 "Athari"
 athari_adherent_plural:0 "Atharis"
 athari_desc:0 "Atharis are Sunnis who do not belong to a school of theology and abstain from the use of speculative theology or human reasoning in matters of creed. They accept the attributes of God as they appear in the holy text, "no questions asked", without delving into their deeper nature or attempting to rationalize them. Atharism is considered one of the three branches of Orthodox Sunni Islam along with the Ash'ari-Maturidis."

 # Imami

 imami_adj:0 "Imami"
 imami_adherent:0 "Imami"
 imami_adherent_plural:0 "Imamis"
 imami_desc:0 "The Twelver Shi'ites, also known as Imamis, believe that Twelve Imams who are free from worldly desires and fully committed to the responsibility of preserving Islam were prophesied to lead the [Glossary( 'Ummah', 'UMMAH_BOLGHAR_GLOSS' )]. They hold that the twelfth Imam, Imam Mahdi, will one day return to lead Muslims into the Day of Judgement."

 # Qarmatians
 qarmatian_desc:0 "An esoteric sect that emerged as a radical offshoot of Isma'ilism, the Qarmatians incorporated elements of Zoroastrianism and rejected many orthodox Islamic practices, including the Hajj. Their interpretation of Islam focused heavily on the esoteric secret meanings of the Qur'an, rather than the apparent outward meanings. They held that The number of Imams was preordained by God to be seven, and there could therefore be no more Imams before the seventh Imam — Muhammad ibn Isma'il — returned to guide the faithful."

 # Zayidi
 zayidi_desc:0 "Zaydis believe that outside of the prophet's immediate family, a true Imam is not infallible, but defined by their struggle against corruption and evil. Zaydis are therefore defined by their belief that Zayd ibn Ali was the rightful successor to the Imamate, due to his sense of justice and rebellion against injustice. A rationalist group, Zaydis place importance on the use of logic when interpreting the Qur'an and Sunnah. Zaydism is often described as a Shia sect with Sunni tendencies due to its recognition of certain Sunni concepts and emphasis on the unity of the Muslim community."
